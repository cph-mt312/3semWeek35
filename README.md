## Wednesday:
#### The following exercise can be found in 02_Wednesday
* **rest1:**
Status of completetion - 100%
## Thursday:
#### The following exercises can be found in 03_Thursday
* **jpql-demo-for-day4:**
Solution is *not* complete - I spent very little time on this. I'm pretty sure none of it works as it should.
I chose to focus on the following Thursday exercise + Friday's exercise instead. I'll revisit this sometime soon.
* **week1-simple-jpa-rest**
The solution to this is nearly done. I've tested all of the endpoints and they seem to be working as intended.
However, I haven't made a JUnit test for any of the 5 methods.

## Friday:
#### The following exercise can be found in 04_Friday
* **JPARestandDTO:**
As with the other exercises I haven't made any JUnit tests. I would consider the rest of it fully complete.
*/api/bankcustomer/all* returns all customer information and */api/bankcustomer/{id}* only returns limited information (i.e. no customer ranking or internal info)

#### *I'm aware that the lack of JUnit testing by no means is satisfactory but I'll make sure to read up on it before next week's exercises.*
